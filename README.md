# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle-

Objective: complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Code: Titanic Logistic Regression-Feature Engineering 3-2.ipynb notebook file.

Dataset: train.csv, test.csv

Dataset dictionary - the dataset consists of the following fields:

•survival	Survival

•pclass	Ticket class	

•Key: 0 = No; 1 = Yes

•sex	Sex	

•Age	Age in years	

•sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	

•parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	

•ticket	Ticket number	

•fare	Passenger fare

•cabin	Cabin number	

•embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

•pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

•age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

•sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

•Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister

•Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

•parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

•Parent = mother, father

•Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

•Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
